### About Me 🐓
Hi, thanks for coming by, I am a Fullstack developer currently working on Web3 applications (Dapps). I'm actively researching how to use Web3 to create more decentralized applications that gives power to the user. I'm passionate about Blockchains, DAOs & Tokenomics.  

I am more interested in working on frontend projects because of the vast experience I have with 

- TypeScript 
- JavaScript, 
- React,
- React Native,
- Flutter, 
- Vue, 
- Svelte, 
- Redux, and webpack.

 I am always looking 👁️👁️ for new ways to improve the user experience, and I focus on well-tested and maintainable code. 
 In my free time, I love experimenting with new technologies and learning about different cultures.


### Web3 Engineer
 During the past 2 years I have learnt quiet a lot about Smart Contract development and the blockchain in general. I have listed Some of the tools I have found to be  more comfortable for me to use during the development process:
 
  - Truffle 🎂
  - Hardhat 👷🏻
  - Remix 🎧
  - Ganache - one click Blockchain 🖱️
  - Solidity/Rust 🦀 I Learnt about Rust when I was implementing my own [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) blockchain for testing so im a nooby 😢
  - Ethers.js/Hether.js 🍭 Hether.js is used in deploying and interacting with smart contracts on the [Hedera network](https://hedera.com/).
  
  So far with this knowledge I have been able to create:
  
    - 🪙 Tokens
    - 🎨 NFTs 
    - 🌐 DAOs
    - 💱 DEXs
    - 📈 Swaps
      🚜 Yield Farming protocols for Web3 games 🕹️
  
  
### Side Projects

2. Google WebRTC Mini Projects
    This projects consist of examples of how to use webrtc in web applications - voice calling, video calling and data sharing
    I have a repo where you can test it out 👇
    https://github.com/Yakumwamba/google_webrtc_svelte. 

3. NFT Analytics Dashboard 🔥🔥 - [Live]("")
    With all the hype about NFTs its easier to loose track of which projects are worth investing in. To solve that problem here is a dashboard that       shows what       kind of NFTs are Trending in real-time  and gives unique insights on the NFTs of interest by using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
    Currently trying to add different types of Social Media content sources that can be manually parsed through pre-trainned AI models to give predictive features to       the Analytics Dashboard. This is a potential mechanical Trading tool for anyone looking to have a deeper look about how various Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) will         evolve over time as influenced by Social Media influencers.
