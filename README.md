I am interested in Web3 üåç because of my WebRTC background. I basically started exploring web3 because of the interest I have in networks especially decentralized networks. I began researching on how web3 and WebRTC can be combined in order to create a more resilient network that is user-centric and also exploring more on how the concept of tokens can be incorporated in such networks. Therefore I have a deep interest in Smart contracts, DAOs, Tokenomics and everything that ensures that there's is a right governance on the distribution of such representation of value.

Currently I'm working with React, TypeScript and JavaScript in building pixel-perfect design, aesthetic and clean user interfaces, with focus on user experience and interaction and to be honest I'm constantly evolving and more open to learn newer ‚ö° stacks.

üí¨ Ask me about open source, Web3, React, TypeScript and Javascript.
