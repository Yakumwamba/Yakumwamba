- 🔭 I am passionate about frontend development, and I have a lot of experience with React, Vue, Svelte, Redux, and webpack.
- 🌱 I am always looking for new ways to improve the user experience, and I focus on well-tested and maintainable code. 
- 👯 In my free time, I love experimenting with new technologies and learning about different cultures.

- ✨ I am fascinated by Web 3.0 because of my WebRTC background. I got interested in Web3 because of my fascination with networks- not just any networks, but    decentralized networks. I started researching how Web3 and WebRTC can be combined to create a more resilient network that is user-centric. I'm also interested in Tokenomics and how to make sure that there is a fair distribution of value in a system like this. 

- 📫 You can find some of my open source projects below:

💬 Ask me about open source, Web 3.0, React, TypeScript and Javascript.
