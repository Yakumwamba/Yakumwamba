I am fascinated by 🌎 Web 3.0 because of my WebRTC background. I got interested in Web 3.0 because of the excitment I have for networks, especially  decentralized networks. I begun researching how Web 3.0 and WebRTC can be combined to create a more resilient network that is user-centric. I'm passionate about  Blockchains, DAOs & Tokenomics and how to make sure that there is a fair distribution of value in a system like this.  

I am passionate about Frontend development, and I have experience with React, Vue, Svelte, Redux, and webpack.
🌱 I am always looking for new ways to improve the user experience, and I focus on well-tested and maintainable code. 
👯 In my free time, I love experimenting with new technologies and learning about different cultures.

Im currently developing a Play-to-Earn NFT Game on Solana Blockchain, for more details follow my Devlog on Twiiter or Discord

🎯 My goal this year is to spend more time understanding video streaming technology and ways in which the Web can be utilized as a plartform for this.

💬 Ask me about open source, Web 3.0, React, TypeScript and Javascript.
